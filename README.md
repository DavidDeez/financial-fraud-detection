# Cost-Sensitive Learning for Imbalanced Financial Fraud Detection

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidolu12/financial-fraud-detection/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb)

Research project implementing cost-sensitive machine learning techniques for highly imbalanced financial fraud detection (1:1000 class ratio).

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of class imbalance in financial fraud detection using ensemble methods and business-optimized thresholding to maximize profit rather than pure accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **86.7% fraud recall** while maintaining 65% precision
- **157% profit increase** over baseline models
- Effective handling of 1:1000 class imbalance using cost-sensitive techniques
